###Deployment
I built this to be effortless, here is how to deploy:

    git push heroku master

Done.

##Contributing
I built this because I was about to build a Sinatra app anyway and wanted to share a solid foundation. If you are doing the same, why not start with this, add anything I missed and send a pull request. Pretty soon this could be quite robust and show off the best practices.

Some things that could use improvement:

- HTML and Search optimization
- Better including of Zurb Javascript files (I shouldn't need to commit them.)
- Better asset compression/middleware caching and what not.
